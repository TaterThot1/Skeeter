# Code Setup

This will cover a more detailed set of instructions to setting up the code. Only file you need to change is config.json...

```
{
"prefix": "%",
"token": "Bot_Token",
"logName" : "Log_Channel_Name",
"greet" : "Welcom_Channel_Name",
"roleName1" : "Muted",
"roleName2" : "Main_Role_1",
"roleName3" : "Main_Role_2",
"roleName4" : "Main_Role_3",
"Your_ID" : "Your_Account_ID",
"Status" : "Moderators"
}
```
 First set the prefix default is %

 Next paste your bots token where it says Bot_Token

After those we have to label two channels. so just put the channel name in the correct spot and ur good to go

Now the just label 4 roles with your first role being mute role and the rest are just non staff member roles that allow talking/typing

THen just copy your id and paste it

Lastly just change the bots presence if you wish
